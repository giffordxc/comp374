This is a basic kernel that supports keyboard input 
for the letters a-z and numbers 0-9.  It will echo back what you type after you hit ENTER.

/***************************BUILDING**************************************/
To build, simply navigate to directory in a terminal, and run the 'make' command.
This will build, compile, and link all proper files into an executable named 'kernel'
After building, run 'make clean' to get rid of unnecessary files.
******************************************************************************
To emulate kernel in qemu, run:

	qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel

To boot with grub, you first have to change the name of the kernel.exe 
to something in the form of kernel-<version> where <version> is an arbitrary number.

Copy the exe to the /boot folder, and restart.
